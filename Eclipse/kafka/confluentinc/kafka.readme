Start the Kafka server by spinning up the containers using the docker-compose command:
$ 
docker-compose up -d

Use the nc command to verify that both the servers are listening on the respective ports:
$ 
nc -zv localhost 22181
$ 
nc -zv localhost 29092

Check the verbose logs while the containers are starting up and verify that the Kafka server is up:
$ 
docker-compose logs kafka | grep -i started
